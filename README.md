# PBTK_Adult_Zebrafish
PBTK model for bisphenols in adult zebrafish. Code written by Ioana Chelcea, adapted from Grech et al. 2019

Repository contains 2 files for running the model
1. PREDATAR_Revision_git.knwf :KNIME workflow containing models modfied to fit each experimental scenario found in literature and displaying all predictions and graph. The main workflow contains the experimental data for BPA (Lindholst et al. 2013, Chen et al. 2017, Fang et al. 2016), BPAF (Shi et al. 2016), BPZ (Chelcea et al. 2022) and TBBPA (Nyholm et al. 2007). The Metanode entitled "All BPs" contains the predictions for all selected bisphenols at a dose of 10 Âµg/L in female adult zebrafish and calculation of the corresponding biococentration factors (BCFs) in organs.
2. Model_parameters_KNIME_Fitted_revision1.xlsx :Contains parameters needed to parameterize the model. Each sheet contains parameters for one of the 11 selected bisphenols and gender-speciffic paramateres (_M for males and _F for females). Place this file in the same folder as the KNIME workflow.

IMPORTANT: Place both files in the same folder and set the local KNIME directory to that folder.
All packages required for running need to be installed.

Required R packages:
plyr
dplyr
deSolve
reshape2
httk
MESS
tidyverse
sensitivity
ggplot2

Trouble shooting:
1. Packages not found even after installing them: Check which version of R is set to use in KNIME. Using an local computer version is more suitable as packages are installed there by default. To change R version go to File>Preferences>KNIME>R> Path to R Home.
